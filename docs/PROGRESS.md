## What was built and verified in this session (2026-10-18)

1. **Pure Node.js Extraction Pipeline (`launcher/app/lib/extract/`)**:
   - `zip.js`: Zero-dependency PKZIP reader supporting uncompressed (0) and Deflate (8) streams using Node's standard `zlib`.
   - `macho.js`: 32-bit universal (fat) and thin Mach-O parser verifying armv7 slice, UUID (`90d6f56a18e2303f8f2053b02a42742e`), and FairPlay encryption (`cryptid == 0`).
   - `level_info.js`: Extracts the anonymous arena string pool and pointer relocations into `level_info.c` (verified 100% byte-for-byte identical to Python).
   - `seq_data.js`: Extracts playback scripts into `seq_data.c` (verified 100% byte-for-byte identical to Python).
   - `logic_tables.js`: Reads data tables and performs 4,291 pointer relocations across 1,118 symbols into `logic_tables.c` (verified 100% byte-for-byte identical to Python).
   - `low32_static.js`: Generates 64-bit low-pointer fixups (`umk3_globals_fixup`) for `gamecode_globals64.c`.
   - `ipa.js`: Orchestrates binary verification, asset unpacking (`res/`), and C table generation in ~2 seconds.

2. **Standalone Toolchain & Parallel Compiler (`launcher/app/lib/toolchain.js` & `compile.js`)**:
   - Automatic download and extraction of pinned Zig 0.13.0 with SHA-256 verification (fallback to system Zig if already present).
   - Multi-threaded compilation pool compiling 74 C source files in parallel.
   - Successful build and link of native 64-bit Linux binary (`umk3-game`) with `-DUMK3_LOW32`, `-no-pie`, and low-pointer memory mapping.
   - Verified native execution on Linux: `UMK3_SHOT=10 ./umk3-game` executed cleanly, producing valid PPM frame capture (`851x1413`).

3. **Packaging Configuration & Release**:
   - Linux: `.tar.gz` portable archive and `.AppImage` standalone executable via `electron-builder`.
   - Windows: `.zip` archive and portable executable (`UMK3-Launcher-Windows.exe`).
   - Packaged and published GitHub Release `v0.2.1` with all 4 release binaries attached.
   - Removed legacy `build_game.ps1` and `setup_res.ps1`.

4. **Full English Localization**:
   - All build stages, progress bars, compiler messages, dialog boxes, and update alerts localized to English.
   - Default UI language set to English (`EN`) while keeping the multi-language toggle for Spanish.

## Verification Suites

1. **Static & Structural Checks (`bash tools/decomp/check.sh`)**
   - Compiles all `src/decomp/` and `src/runtime/` units with `-Wall -Wextra -O2`.
   - Zero errors across the entire tree.
2. **Banned Words & Clean-Room Audit (`python3 tools/decomp/check_banned_words.py`)**
   - Passes with 0 errors.
3. **Launcher Unit Tests (`node --test test/*.js` in `launcher/app/`)**
   - 15 unit tests passing covering configuration, ZIP reader, Mach-O parser, globals transformation, and launcher state.
