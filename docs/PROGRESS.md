## Release 0.1.8 beta (2026-10-22): character editor, mods in the viewer, Blender round trip, playable bosses

Published as the GitHub pre-release `v0.1.8-beta`, packaged as 0.1.7 was
(`launcher/make_release.py` over `electron-builder --win dir`; `electron-
builder --linux tar.gz` repacked with exec bits). On top of the MODS section
below (unreleased until now), what Mary asked for next:

### Motaro and Shao Kahn as players (debug menu FIGHTER 1/2)

- Mary's crash report (`running address 0x04840a04`, SHAO KAHN vs MOTARO,
  both builds, "always been there"). Reproduced with no window: the headless
  fight simulator (`fight_headless.c`) built with a crash handler, Shao Kahn
  as player 1 holding one button. The game never hands a boss to a player,
  and the per-fighter rows a player's buttons read stop at 24 or 25 words:
  - `DoSwitchJump` (other.c) read `row[25]` past the button rows and called
    the next table as code. Port guard: no button handler for c >= 24.
  - `get_char_ani*` / `get_his_char_ani*`: the bosses' animation tables hold
    38 animations, the others 73, and Motaro's second table is not a table.
    A flip read frame data as an animation (`find_last_frame` from
    `t_do_flip`). Port guard `ani_fetch`: a boss's missing animation is its
    stance.
  - `get_char_stk`: Motaro's strike row has 7 entries and Shao Kahn's 6
    (22 to 27 for the others). Port guard: none, and the two strike checks
    treat a missing strike as no hit.
- Checked: 736 headless fights, both bosses as player 1 and 2 against four
  fighters with 46 held inputs each, none crash; ordinary fights unchanged.
  **Mary has not played it yet.** The bosses only do what the game gives them.

### Mod data: `data.ini` over the fight tables

- Both table generators (`launcher/app/lib/extract/logic_tables.js`,
  `tools/build/logic_tables.py`) end `logic_tables.c` with
  `umk3_logic_names[]`: every word table by its name in the binary, its
  address and length.
- `mods_apply_data()` (runtime/mods.c), called after the asset root is set:
  each mod's `data.ini` lines `table[word] = value`, lowest priority first.
  Unit-tested standalone (priority, signed values, unknown names reported).
- A strike record (`stk_*`, 7 words, `strike_check_regs`): reach, top,
  width, height (signed 16-bit, measured from the fighter facing right:
  left = x + reach - width), reaction, damage (high byte full, low byte chip
  on block), squeeze. Shared rows: the six ninjas use `nj_strikes`, the
  three robots `robo_strikes`, the three female ninjas `fn_strikes`.
- Data mods change the fight: online, both players need the same mods.

### Launcher

- **CHARACTER EDITOR** (`sections/mods/ModEditor.svelte`, new tab): per
  fighter, the basic strikes (damage, chip, box, reaction) with a visual
  hitbox editor (`HitboxEditor.svelte`, drag to move, corner to size); the
  special moves and finishers the move list names (`seq_<fighter>_*`), with
  the missing ones marked (Noob Saibot, Motaro and Shao Kahn have no
  specials; Reptile and the hidden ninjas lack finishers); every per-fighter
  numeric table; the game's texts (a copy of `<language>_text.dat` in the
  mod: names, move list); the fighter's textures replaced by PNG. Reads
  `build/logic_tables.c` (`gameTables` in lib/mods.js).
- **Viewer**: SHOW WITH the game alone, the mods that are on, or one mod
  (`resRead(rel, layer)`, pictures told apart by their bytes); EXPORT ITS
  TEXTURES; EXPORT RIG (FBX); REPLACE ANIMATION / REPLACE MODEL from an FBX
  (`ui/src/lib/mods/fbxin.js`): a binary FBX reader, the FBX transform
  chain, and a similarity fit from the file's cluster rests to the game's
  T-pose or bind pose, so Blender's axes and units do not matter. An
  animation replaces one clip's frames in the `.skinanim` (resampled to the
  clip's length); a model is written as a new `.skin` on the same bones
  (each material to one of the fighter's blocks). Checked through Blender
  5.2 (import and export with defaults): Kano's clip back within 0.05
  units, Sindel's model (2 blocks) within 0.14; from the T-pose rest the
  model within 3.7 (the T-pose fit's own error). **The game has not loaded
  a replaced .skin yet: Mary's test.**
- Manager: COVER (cover.png/jpg, preview.* still read), SEE IN THE VIEWER.
- Not done: duplicating a fighter into a new slot (27th). Every per-fighter
  table of the game (strike rows, animation tables, the select screen's 26
  places, names, sounds, portraits) would have to grow; a session of its own.

## After 0.1.7: MODS section, game-side mod overlay, Linux build fixes (2026-10-22, released in 0.1.8)

Mary asked for a MODS option in the launcher's menu: a mod manager, a viewer
of the game's files and an exporter for Blender. All three are in, plus the
two Linux faults she reported on 0.1.6/0.1.7.

### The game reads mods (`src/runtime/mods.c`)

- `<game>/mods/<folder>/**` is indexed by lowercased file name at start-up
  (`mods_init`, called from `set_asset_root`). A mod replaces a game file by
  carrying a file of the same name, in any sub-folder.
- `mods/mods.ini` holds the order, highest priority first, as `on=<folder>`
  / `off=<folder>` lines; folders it does not name are on, after the rest.
  The first mod in the order that has a name wins.
- Hooked in `lime_platform.c` `resolve()` (every `limeLoadFile`, sound and
  music path) and in `draw_gl.c` `load_rgba`, where textures also match by
  stem (a `.png` in a mod replaces the game's `.pvr`) and a mod's `X` also
  serves `X_LOW`.
- `mod.ini` and `preview.*` at a mod's top level are the mod's own and are
  never served. Tested standalone (priority, sub-folders, _LOW, unnamed
  folders on).

### Launcher: MODS (`ui/src/lib/sections/SecMods.svelte`, `lib/mods.js`)

- **Manager**: create a mod (name, author, category: textures, audio, music,
  models), order (up/down = priority), on/off, category filter, preview
  picture, details with every file and the game file it replaces (files that
  replace nothing are flagged), add files, open the folder, delete (a second
  press). Writes `mods/mods.ini` and `mods/<mod>/mod.ini`.
- **Viewer** (three.js 0.170): fighters, stages, other models and textures
  from `res/`. Fighters are skinned on the CPU from the game's `.skin`,
  `.bones` and `.skinanim`; one clip or all, play/pause/frame, outfits,
  bones, wireframe, T-pose or the game's own pose. Textures can be copied
  into a mod to edit.
- **Exporter**: FBX (binary 7.4: skeleton, skin, one action per clip), USD
  as USDA, USDC (crate 0.8.0, written by `ui/src/lib/mods/usd.js`) or USDZ,
  and OBJ (mesh only); textures as PNG. Fighters with every animation, one,
  or none; rest pose T-pose or bind; their other outfits as PNG. Written to
  `<game>/exports/<name>_<FORMAT>/`.
- The T-pose: the rest pose is not in `.bones`, which is why exports came
  out broken. `ui/src/lib/mods/rig.js` solves the bind pose from the clips
  (least squares over rigid fits), finds hips/spine/arms/legs from the
  skeleton's shape, faces the figure along +Z by its knees, turns the head
  to the front by symmetry (Kano's head was sideways), straightens it, and
  fits a rest mesh so Blender's skinning reproduces the game's within about
  2 mm on average. Motaro (centaur) keeps the bind pose. Sindel's hair took
  the wrong texture; blocks now take their texture from the meshset mesh
  with the same triangle count.
- Checked by importing into Blender 5.2 headless (FBX, OBJ, USDA, USDC,
  USDZ: bones, actions, textures) and by opening the USDC in pxr 26.03.

### Linux

- `fatal error: 'GL/gl.h' file not found` (Mary's 0.1.7 log): the launcher
  now ships the GL, KHR and SDL2 headers in
  `src/runtime/platform/linux-include/` (Mesa/Khronos MIT, SDL zlib; see its
  README) and links `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` / `libGL.so.1` by soname when the
  `-dev` symlinks are missing. The runtime cross-compiles for
  x86_64-linux-gnu with Zig against those headers alone; **linking on a real
  Linux machine is untested.**
- "could not unpack the update" (0.1.6): the updater took the Windows zip.
  It now picks the `linux*.tar.gz` asset, unpacks it with the system `tar`,
  and installs with a shell script (`apply.sh`) that waits for the launcher
  to exit, swaps the folders, keeps `res/`, `mods/` and the ini files, and
  restarts it. Linux users on 0.1.7 still have the old updater and must
  download the next release by hand once.

## Release 0.1.7 beta (2026-10-22)

Published as the GitHub pre-release `v0.1.7-beta`, built the same way as
0.1.6 (`launcher/make_release.py` over `electron-builder --win dir` for the
Windows zip; `electron-builder --linux dir` repacked with exec bits for the
Linux tar.gz). On top of 0.1.6: the launcher rework and the 64-bit debug
crash fixes below, the SvelteKit port of the launcher's window, and the
Linux Zig download fix. Mary asked for the release before testing the debug
fixes; the port's launcher was in her test folder (`launcher/bin`) and
opens there.

### The launcher's window is a SvelteKit app (`launcher/app/ui/`)

- Svelte 5 + SvelteKit 3 (`@sveltejs/kit` 3.1, `adapter-static`, hash
  router), built into `launcher/app/renderer/` by `npm run ui`
  (`scripts/build-ui.js`), which electron-builder also runs before it packs
  (`build.beforePack`). `renderer/` is generated and git-ignored.
- `build-ui.js` makes SvelteKit's root `/_app/` paths relative (the page is
  loaded from disk) and recomputes the Content-Security-Policy hashes of
  the inline start-up script and of SvelteKit's route announcer's style.
- SvelteKit 3 notes: the config lives in `sveltekit({...})` in
  `ui/vite.config.js` (no `svelte.config.js`); `$lib` is gone, the code
  imports `#lib/...` through `ui/package.json`'s `imports`; no page options
  with the hash router.
- One theme: `ui/src/lib/theme/tokens.css` names every colour, surface,
  finish and size; `base.css` holds the shared controls. State is one
  `$state` object in `app.svelte.js`; sections and pieces are components.
- Matched to Mary's high-quality capture of the console's main menu:
  eight-block rings (36 degrees a block, 9 between) with brushed-silver rims
  and a lavender glow, 39 units between the rings' halos; a thin ring round
  the picture; the menu's curve, text size and spacing measured off it; the
  selection orb is a glass sphere with a red M turning in it; the command
  bar higher, slanted ends, fine lines; the cloud crimson top left and
  bottom right with a blue streak down the middle; the theme in lavender,
  silver and navy, the pages' glass deeper so text reads over the traces.

### Linux: Zig download stopped at once (`EXIT CODE: -1`)

- The log said only `Build failed:` -- an error with no message, which is
  what Node's `https` gives (an AggregateError) when every address of the
  server runs out of its connect time: Node 20 tries IPv6 then IPv4 for
  250 ms each. `lib/toolchain.js` now allows 5 s per address, retries over
  IPv4 alone, and reports the parts of such an error (`describeError`).
- Checked on Windows: the Linux archive downloads and its SHA-256 matches.
  The original failure could not be reproduced here (a fast link); **not
  yet run on Linux**.

## Launcher rework (2026-10-22, not yet tested by Mary)

- Menu: smaller lines and orb; PLAY moved second, under COMPILE YOUR .IPA.
- No game compiled in either build (`root:get` -> `any`): the menu shows
  COMPILE alone; the first successful compile relaunches the launcher
  (`app:relaunch`, app.relaunch + exit) so the whole menu appears.
- A section opened from the menu fills the window, after the console
  release's online pages: its name between blue arrows (Q / E, the pad's
  triggers or bumpers step through sections), the GRAPHICS and CONTROLS
  pages in a second row between arrows (left / right, the d-pad), the
  chosen page with light lines over and under it; Esc / B returns to the
  menu, which keeps its old layout.
- Backdrop shared by both: a generated cloud of red, purple and blue light
  (`nebulaURL`), dark circuit grooves with grey edges, a big ring of short
  thick marble blocks and, on the menu only, a smaller one to the right.
- Home screen laid out as the console's main menu, in the rings' own
  1600 x 900 box (`--k` in the theme's tokens.css), so it holds at any window size:
  the title top right with a dark border, a white-blue halo and light rays
  behind it; the player's picture `aditional textures/image.png` (read at
  run time by `hero:get`, never shipped: it is game art) inside the small
  ring, tinted blue and faded towards every edge; the description box under
  it; the menu down the left 70 units a line. The version moved to the top
  left corner.

## Debug crashes on 64-bit, fixed (2026-10-22, not yet tested by Mary)

Both from Mary's crash logs, symbolized with the build's .pdb:

- Opening the debug menu, or its STAGE list: `stage_name` (debug_menu.c)
  read Level_Info's name field (+0x1c, a 32-bit word) as an 8-byte pointer
  and snprintf crashed. Now `const char *P32`.
- HITBOXES on: `hb_draw` (game_main.c) read the fighters at G +0xbc /
  +0x214 the same way and `hb_body` crashed. Now `P32` too.

Both files compile for x86 and x64. Mary also reported that the stage of
a debug fight stays chosen afterwards. Not changed: her logs show no debug
fight in the session where CAVE repeated (Arcade, then Survival, then
Karnage), and Karnage and Survival keep `LevelSelect` by the iOS game's
own rule (FrontEnd.c, modes 3/4/5). Waiting for her steps.

## Reported by Mary on 0.1.6 beta, to fix after the launcher rework (2026-10-22)

Not investigated yet; each needs its mechanism traced in the binary first.

- **64-bit:** the FLAWLESS VICTORY text is not shown (fine in 32-bit).
- **Reptile's fatalities** sometimes do not work fully; in one of them he
  only raises his arms.
- **Hitboxes** (the debug view) crash the game. Fixed, see above.
- **Linux:** compiling in the launcher fails at once:
  `1/5 Preparing compiler toolchain... Starting download of Zig 0.13.0
  compiler / Build failed: / EXIT CODE: -1` (lib/toolchain.js).

## Release 0.1.6 beta (2026-10-22)

Published as the GitHub pre-release `v0.1.6-beta`, two packages:

- `UMK3-PC-0.1.6-beta.zip` (Windows): `launcher/make_release.py` over the
  `electron-builder --win dir` output. It now copies all of `src/` (the old
  file list had lost `mp_eos.c` and `ui_alert.c` and still named the
  removed .ps1 scripts), the EOS SDK from `TOOLS/eos` (headers, the Win64
  DLL, eos.ini; git-ignored, never in the repository), and builds the stub
  with zig when llvm-mingw is missing. Checked: the release folder compiles
  umk3-game64.exe (with EOS) and umk3-game.exe from the 1.2.59 .ipa.
- `UMK3-PC-0.1.6-beta-linux-x64.tar.gz`: `electron-builder --linux tar.gz`,
  repacked so the launcher and helpers are executable (a tar made on
  Windows has no exec bits). The EOS SDK lands in `resources/tools/eos`
  (Windows merges TOOLS/ into tools/), so `findEosDir` in compile.js looks
  for both spellings. **Never run on Linux.**
- Known: the launcher's updater takes the first .zip, so a Linux launcher
  would offer the Windows zip; Linux players update by hand.
- Open question for Mary: whether the EOS SDK headers may be redistributed
  under Epic's licence, and whether eos.ini's client credentials are a
  game-client policy (they are public in the zip).

## Debug menu, mouse wheel, iPhone-style boxes on Linux (2026-10-22, tested on Windows)

Port, not in the binary. Built for Windows x64 and x86; the Linux files
pass a zig `x86_64-linux-gnu` compile with the SDL2 lint header, but nobody
has run them on Linux yet. Mary tested all of it on Windows on 2026-10-22.

- **Debug menu (F2)** is laid out like the settings menu (Esc): a side panel
  with three categories (FIGHT = fighters + round + Arcade + cheats, MENUS,
  TOOLS/OPCIONES = options + tools + save states), sections under headings,
  a list that scrolls, and a list of values that opens with Enter or a
  click. Labels are Spanish or English, following the game's language.
  Picking a SCREEN or a FINISHER from its list does it at once.
- **New debug options:**
  - INFINITE HEALTH (player 1, 2 or both) and FREEZE CLOCK. These are the
    PortDbgHealth/PortDbgClock hooks in logic/other.c's bar_reducer and
    t_clock4, beside training's. game_main.c forces them off in an online
    fight.
  - FRAMES PER SECOND and ONLINE NUMBERS (rb_stats: frame, delay, remote
    lead, rollbacks, deepest, holds, desyncs), drawn under the INFO line.
- **Mouse wheel:** plat_mouse_wheel (WM_MOUSEWHEEL, SDL_MOUSEWHEEL) moves
  the cursor in both menus and in their open lists.
- **ui_alert.c:** the iPhone OS 3 boxes now live in one file shared by both
  backends: the alerts (plat_ask), the menus, the grid, the badge, and the
  pad button pictures.
  - Windows supplies GDI's Arial and its raw keys (ui_alert.h).
  - Linux uses stb_truetype (platform/stb, public domain/MIT) with the first
    font it finds: "aditional textures/fonts/ui_bold.ttf"/"ui.ttf", then
    Liberation Sans, DejaVu, Noto, then fontconfig. Linux also gets the
    keyboard and pad pictures, and the pad's kind comes from the SDL vendor
    id.
- **Alerts with the pad:**
  - Left / right (pad or arrow keys) light a button.
  - South or START presses the lit button, or OK when none is lit.
  - East is CANCEL.

## Rollback netcode for ONLINE fights (2026-10-22, in 0.1.6 beta)

Status: **tested by Mary on one PC, two windows (LAN), 64-bit:** fights run on
both, 0 desyncs, snapshots 0.8 ms / 6.1 MB, a few holds. Not yet tested over the
internet or 64 vs 32 bits. Port, not in the binary.

Fixed while testing (2026-10-22):
- `limeMalloc` takes its blocks from the save-state arena during a rollback fight;
  its own region is not rolled back, so a re-run frame freed a block twice.
- Snapshots skip `PreloadedCharacters` (60 MB the fight only reads); the copy was
  66 MB and 11 ms a frame.
- The guest waits, before loading the fight, for the host's hello and takes its
  level. Before, each side loaded its own random level; with the classic netcode
  the host's level arrived mid-fight and the guest crashed in `RenderLevelBG`.
- Multiplayer versus screen: the kode wheels each side may press were transcribed
  wrong (armv7 0x16b98: host 0..4, guest 7..9); portraits and wheels now sit at
  the screen's edges as on `FE_Task_VS_Screen`.
- 64-bit crash reports unwind the stack (.pdata) and print exe offsets.

- `src/runtime/rollback.c`: both machines run the fight from both players' inputs;
  only inputs travel (packets 20 INPUT, 21 HELLO, 22 HASH over `mp_net`). The
  remote input is predicted as the last confirmed one; a late input that differs
  rolls the state back and re-runs the frames silent and undrawn. Input delay 2
  (`UMK3_RB_DELAY`), at most 8 frames predicted, a desync hash every 60 frames
  (`DESYNC at frame` in the log). `UMK3_NETCODE=classic` turns it off.
- `src/runtime/savestate.c`: per-frame snapshots (`st_rb_*`) of `.umkstd/.umkstb`
  plus the arena pages written during the fight (MEM_WRITE_WATCH). Files built with
  `UMK3_NO_ROLLBACK` (lime_menu, lime_platform, lime_app, wav, limeMPGameSpecific)
  keep their state out of it; `PreloadedCharacters` too.
- Determinism: `random32` uses `umk3_rand`, held in the state; the frame step is
  pinned to 1. A recorded fight replays identically on x64 over 3038 ticks; x86
  differs only in the event queue (address-derived arguments), not yet fixed.
- No pause in a rollback fight yet (a synced pause is still to do).
- Runs over the LAN transport and over EOS (0.1.6 beta).

## Mileena's fatalities (2026-10-22)

Both were reported by the tester and both are confirmed fixed in her build.

- **Nail fatality (BIG CUP in the wrong place):** checked against the binary function by function (`RenderLevelPlayers`, `RenderPlayer`, `RenderAnimatedCharacter`, the bone attach in `LIME_RenderScene`, `limeMatrixMult`). The missing piece was the `else` arm of `RenderAnimatedCharacter` at 0x5c2f4: a frame whose body is not skinned still calls `GenerateMatrices`. Without it, `MatrixPalette2` kept the other fighter's pose and the cup followed his hand.
- **Suck-kiss fatality (victim's body kept reappearing):** `RenderLevelPlayers`, the event code (`LIME_TriggerEventFromSceneH`, `LIME_UpdateEvents`, `LIME_RenderEvents`, `CountEventsMatching`, `LIME_TriggerEventsFromSceneOffsetIfFollowing`), `mk3_update`, `t_r_kiss_suck`, `t_mframew` and `fastxfer_thread` all match the binary. The divergence was a port-only block that replaced a frame-list `-1` with the last pose. The victim's frames 1399..1405 are `-1`; held at 327, an invisible fighter re-fires that frame's events every draw. The block now applies only to Classic Sub-Zero.

## What was built and verified in this session (2026-10-18)

1. **Pure Node.js Extraction Pipeline (`launcher/app/lib/extract/`)**:
   - `zip.js`: Zero-dependency PKZIP reader supporting uncompressed (0) and Deflate (8) streams using Node's standard `zlib`.
   - `macho.js`: 32-bit universal (fat) and thin Mach-O parser verifying armv7 slice, UUID (`90d6f56a18e2303f8f2053b02a42742e`), and FairPlay encryption (`cryptid == 0`).
   - `level_info.js`: Extracts the anonymous arena string pool and pointer relocations into `level_info.c` (verified 100% byte-for-byte identical to Python).
   - `seq_data.js`: Extracts playback scripts into `seq_data.c` (verified 100% byte-for-byte identical to Python).
   - `logic_tables.js`: Reads data tables and performs 4,291 pointer relocations across 1,118 symbols into `logic_tables.c` (verified 100% byte-for-byte identical to Python).
   - `low32_static.js`: Generates 64-bit low-pointer fixups (`umk3_globals_fixup`) for `gamecode_globals64.c`.
   - `ipa.js`: Orchestrates binary verification, asset unpacking (`res/`), and C table generation in ~2 seconds.

2. **Standalone Toolchain & Parallel Compiler (`launcher/app/lib/toolchain.js` & `compile.js`)**:
   - Automatic download and extraction of pinned Zig 0.13.0 with SHA-256 verification (fallback to system Zig if already present).
   - Multi-threaded compilation pool compiling 74 C source files in parallel.
   - Successful build and link of native 64-bit Linux binary (`umk3-game`) with `-DUMK3_LOW32`, `-no-pie`, and low-pointer memory mapping.
   - Verified native execution on Linux: `UMK3_SHOT=10 ./umk3-game` executed cleanly, producing valid PPM frame capture (`851x1413`).

3. **Packaging Configuration & Release**:
   - Linux: `.tar.gz` portable archive and `.AppImage` standalone executable via `electron-builder`.
   - Windows: `.zip` archive and portable executable (`UMK3-Launcher-Windows.exe`).
   - Packaged and published GitHub Release `v0.2.1` with all 4 release binaries attached.
   - Removed legacy `build_game.ps1` and `setup_res.ps1`.

4. **Full English Localization**:
   - All build stages, progress bars, compiler messages, dialog boxes, and update alerts localized to English.
   - Default UI language set to English (`EN`) while keeping the multi-language toggle for Spanish.

5. **Linux LP64 Memory Model Compatibility & Freeze Resolution**:
   - Diagnosed runtime game freeze during character mesh loading: `sizeof(long)` is 4 bytes on ARMv7 iOS and Win32/Win64 (LLP64), but 8 bytes on Linux x86_64 (LP64).
   - In `Players.c:1918`, `meshbaseFile` pointer arithmetic `base + 1` and `hdr[0]` doubled offsets, causing `meshCount` to read as 4.5 quintillion and triggering an infinite loop on `LAC: meshbase out of ram`.
   - In accordance with the project rule to never modify the 1:1 decompiled C files in `src/decomp/`, the fix was implemented in the runtime layer: `src/runtime/savestate.h` includes standard/POSIX and GL headers before defining `#define long int` for state files under Linux 64-bit builds, with `compile.js` passing `-DUMK3_NO_LONG_REMAP` for `text.c`.
   - Verified in GDB and runtime: Kano (`who=0`, `meshCount=366`) and Sonya (`who=1`) loaded successfully and the game loop proceeded into active gameplay.
   - Launcher UI dynamically detects platform (`window.umk3.platform`): displaying `LINUX` with `64 BITS (UMK3-GAME)` on Linux hosts, and targeting the native `umk3-game` executable.

## Verification Suites

1. **Static & Structural Checks (`bash tools/decomp/check.sh`)**
   - Compiles all `src/decomp/` and `src/runtime/` units with `-Wall -Wextra -O2`.
   - Zero errors across the entire tree.
2. **Banned Words & Clean-Room Audit (`python3 tools/decomp/check_banned_words.py`)**
